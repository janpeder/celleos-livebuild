# celleos-livebuild

Short description of this project:
Variant of Debian Linux for use in prison cells by prisoners without supervision. Focus is on security and education.

Features/roadmap:
* Quick and easy install with USB stick and no internet, with minimal user interaction. Reason: Minimize work, because teachers have other things to do. Also less interaction during install means fewer mistakes, which in turn means better security.
* Blocking of all USB devices exept keyboard and mice and whitelisted devices. This is done with the USBGuard software.
* Blocking of all internet using firewall - not implemented yet.
*
